    about me

  <article>
    <p>
      I'm a freelance software developer who resides in Accra, Ghana.
      I have been professionally building software applications for the past 4+ years.
      I have worked on both desktop and mobile applications specifically targeting Windows and Android OS respectively.
      However, for the last two years, majority of my works have been on web applications either as a front-end or back-end
      developer and occasionally as a full-stack developer.
    </p>

    <p>I have had the opportunity and experience of working on a couple of projects single-handedly and also joined teams to work on
       and maintain enterprise solutions.
       I like to solve problems.

      <li>Angular</li>
